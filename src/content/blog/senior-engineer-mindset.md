Being a senior engineer isn't just about writing more complex code. It's about knowing *why* you're writing it, and sometimes, knowing when not to write it at all.

## The Shift in Perspective
Early in your career, your focus is entirely on execution. You're given a task, and success means solving it efficiently. But as you transition to a senior role, the metrics for success change. You must start focusing on architecture, system design, and the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

## Mentorship and Leadership
One of the key differences between a mid-level and a senior engineer is the impact they have on their team. A true senior engineer acts as a force multiplier, elevating the skills of those around them through code reviews, pairing, and architectural guidance.
